The java instanceof operator is used to test whether the object is an instance of the
specified type (class or subclass or an interface).
The instanceof operator in java is also known as a type comparison operator because it
compares the instance with a reference type. It returns either true or false. If we apply
the instanceof operator with any reference variable that has a null value, it returns false
eg
class Bird{
public static void main(String args[]){
Bird b1=new Bird();
System.out.println(b1 instanceof Bird);
}
}
