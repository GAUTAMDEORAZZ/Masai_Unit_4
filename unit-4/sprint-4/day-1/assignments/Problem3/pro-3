Difference between abstract class and Interface???.
An abstract class can have  both abstract and non-abstract method where as an Interface only have abstract method since java 8 ,after it have  a default and an static method.
An abstract class does not support multiple inheritance but in interface multiple inheritance can be support. 
An Abstract class can have final, non-final, static and nonstatic variables But inside interface only static and final variable is available.
An Abstract class can provide the implementation of interface.But an interface cannot implement abstract class.
An abstract class can extend another Java class and implement multiple Java interfaces.But an interface only extends another java interface.
A Java abstract class can have class members like private ,protected, etc.But in interface members are only public and default.
